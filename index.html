        He was born December 18, 1946, in Cincinnati, Ohio, but grew up in Pheonix, Arizona. His mother was a pianist and restauranteur while his father was an electrical engineer.  Steven moved to California for college to pursue his passion for filmmaking. In 1968, Universal gave him the opportunity to write and direct a short film 35mm Amblin'. Universal's Vice President Sidney Sheinberg was so impressed that Spielberg was offered a 7-year directing contract resulting in Spielberg dropping out of college one year later to direct TV shows for universal.

He would continue directing box office hits such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), E.T (1982), and the Indiana Jones Series. After taking a break from filmmaking, he returned to the box office in the 90s directing massive hits such as Jurassic Park and Schindlers list.
